### Cloud computing advantages

* High availability, 
	- continuous user experience
	- no apparent downtime
* Scalability 
	- vertical, variable RAM and CPU to increase compute capacity
	- horizontal, more instances using VMs and other tech
* Elasticity
	- apps can have autoscaling
* Agility 
	- easy and quick deployment and configuration
* Geo-distribution
	- global
* Disaster recovery
	- back up services 

### Cloud computing is consumption-based 

* No upfront cost
* no need for infrastructure 
* flexible, pay more only if you need more and stop paying for what you
don't need

### Capital expense vs. operating expense

* CapEx: up-front spending on physical infrastructure deducted over time
* OpEx: pay as you go for services, deduct expense in real time. No upfront
cost

### Cloud service models

* Iaas: infrastructure-as-a-Service, manages the 'physical' computing 
environment. Keeps hardware up to date. Enables rapid deployment of compute
devices
* Paas: platform-as-a-Service, add networking resources to IaaS, provides an
environment to host users applications
* SaaS: software-as-a-Service, cloud provider takes care of the entire 
application environment
* Serverless computing: similar to PaaS, 

### Cloud Computing types

* Public cloud: cloud services purchased and delivered over the internet
by third party vendor
* Private cloud: on site data center
* Hybrid cloud:

### Azure organization hierarchy

* Management groups: manage access, policy, compliance over multiple 
subscriptions
* Subscriptions: group of user accounts and their resources. Each
subscription is limited by a number of resources
* Resource groups: 
* Resources: instances of your tools, VMs, apps, DBs, etc...

### Subscription types

* Billing boundary: different subscriptions may have different billing 
types and requirements
* Access control boundary: subscriptions can mirror business organization
structure and security
* Environment subscription: Dev, testing, security
* Organizational structures: control what team gets what resources 
* Billing tracking: what team is spending what
* Subscription limits: they exist, circumvent by adding more subscriptions

### Azure regions

* When a resource is deployed a region (specific datacenter location) must 
be chosen
* Availability zones: provide security through redundancy with duplicate 
datacenters in a single region
